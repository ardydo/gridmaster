an asigment for a coursera course

So for this course you're supposed to design a paper game taht can fir in  so here it is. This is actually the second version of the game because the first one was quite bad.

It's a pretty simple game. Open the game image for the board and try to read the rules. Fail miserably because of the poor resolution that is 100% my fault them come back here and read it to play.
